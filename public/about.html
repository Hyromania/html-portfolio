<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I was born on November 24, 1995, in Bahçelievler, Istanbul. I received my primary and secondary education at Yeşilyuva Primary School,
  where I resided in Küçükçekmece, Istanbul.After graduating from middle school, my family sent me to Saide Zorlu Trade Vocational High 
  School in Avcılar to study Accounting, as I was not a very successful student. </p>
   
<p>After high school I completed a 2-year program in International Trade at Arel University through vertical transfer. During this time, 
  I did an accounting internship at Defacto for 1 year and worked for 3 months. As accounting was not my area of interest,<br>
  I chose International Affairs as my major through distance education during this time. While completing my 4-year program at AÖF, 
  I also worked for about 3.5 years at Zara call center project, which is an Inditex project. </p>   

<p>After completing my military service, 
  I started working as a Procurement and Planning Support staff at Lescon. Unfortunately, due to life circumstances, 
  I didn't have many career choices or perhaps I could say I took refuge in that. As I grew older,
  I realized that some responsibilities were increasing, so I needed to take a step forward in my career. 
  Since I had been interested in computers since childhood, I wanted to try the software industry. 
  I liked it. This website I created is the first website where I used HTML and CSS. 
  Also, as my English is not very good, I received some support from ChatGPT while writing this text.
  Thank you very much for reading this far. In the future, I will develop myself even more and upload it to Github.</p>
